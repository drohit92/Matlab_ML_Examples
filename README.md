Matlab Machine Learning/Computer Vision examples

I will try to provide all the working implementations of the Machine Learning/ Computer Vision algorithms I have tried in the past.

Machine Learning

1. K- Nearest Neighbours
2. Naive Bayes
3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
4. LDA (Linear Component Analysis)

Computer Vision

1. Pyramids
2. HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
3. LBP (Local binary patterns)
